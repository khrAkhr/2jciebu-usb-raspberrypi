# 2jciebu-usb-raspberrypi
It is a sample program for evaluating Omron's sensor 2JCIE-BU with Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.  

2JCIE-BU is a multifunction sensor module that can be used for sensing various environmental information.  
Various sensors such as temperature, humidity, light, barometric pressure, noise, 3 axis acceleration, etc. are equipped.  
Earthquakes can be judged based on highly accurate vibration acceleration.  
We utilize a volatile organic compound (VOC GAS) sensor to realize continuous monitoring of indoor air quality.  
USB and BluetoothÂ® are provided as interfaces.
